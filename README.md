## About the Game

Katamensions was made as a request for a code test, inspired by the Katamari series with the addition of dimension-switching mechanics.

## Gameplay

Roll a sticky ball that grows as it collects objects. The twist is the ability to switch between dimensions. Your goal is to create a Katamari of at least 80 meters.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Unity 2022.3.0f1
3. Run the game within the Unity editor or build the game for your desired platform.

## Controls

- **Movement**: Use the WASD keys to move the Katamari.
- **Dimension Switch**: Roll near a portal and press the Space Bar to switch between dimensions.
