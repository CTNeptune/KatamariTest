## About the Game

Katamensions is the result of a code test inspired by the Katamari series with the addition of dimension-switching mechanics.

## Gameplay

Roll a sticky ball that grows as it collects objects. The twist is the ability to switch between dimensions. Your goal is to create a Katamari of at least 80 meters.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository using `git clone`.
2. Open the project in Unity (ensure you're using a compatible version).
3. Run the game within the Unity editor or build the game for your desired platform.

## Controls

- **Movement**: Use the WASD keys to move the Katamari.
- **Dimension Switch**: Roll near a portal and press the Space Bar to switch between dimensions.
